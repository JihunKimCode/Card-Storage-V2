A simple webpage for those who want to see their cards digitally.

## How to Use
- Upload CSV so you can see your cards digitally.
- Use this [CSV template](https://github.com/JihunKimCode/Card-Storage-V2/blob/main/pokemon_cards_v2.csv).
  - CSV must have a **Set Name and Number** for each card.
  - Users can customize or remove the **Foil column** of the template as they like.

## Features
- Filter by **Set, Rarity, Artist Name, Type, and Count**.
  - Users can add one more filter as they want.
- Filter by **Search Query**.
  - It also supports a dropdown menu.
  - Random Search is also available.
- Sorting
  - By **Artist Name, Card Name, Count, Foil, Price, Release Date, Rarity, and Type**.
  - Foil sorting works only when a user uses the Foil column with "Holo", "Reverse", and "Non-Holo".
